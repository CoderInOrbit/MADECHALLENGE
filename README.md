# MADECHALLENGE

Welp, so here's the thing. That MADE front-end challenge was seriously lacking some rainbows and shit. 

So I added some Beyonc√©s.

That's just my go at it. Added a media query for the smaller resolutions, although you should probably consider rethinking this for the mobile experience. You know, you can't hover with a finger. Duh.
Anyway, cheers bitches ~
